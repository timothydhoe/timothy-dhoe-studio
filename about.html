        <p class="body">I love working for both print and digital but with a strong focus on branding. We view
          the brands we work with through an artistic lens, but with the sensibility of entrepreneurs.
          We use this balance to design amazing brands and spaces — from local startups to global powerhouses.

          <h5>Little details matter</h5>
          <p>I love the quirky, specific details&#8212;the bits that infuse brands with colour, character and meaning. I prefer for brands to look like they were made by humans for humans.</p>

          <h5>For people</h5>
          <p>My designs will always be for people. I will always look for the textures of real lives and real stories, which are what we need to make brands interesting. And, it keeps us and the work we deliver grounded and true.</p>

        <div class="col-four">
          <h5>Focussed on experience </h5>
          <p>A brand is consumed as an experience. Whether it’s packaging, environment, digital or apparel, how a brand makes you feel is what we are crafting.</p>

          <h5>Story time</h5>
          <p>Well-made brands don't make things up. They have a story to tell, and on top of that, they tell it truthfully and with a human voice I promise you will gather a following no matter what. (don't start a cult though)</p>
